# JAÇA CITY - WATCH PARTY

**An open web platform for watching YouTube videos in groups, integrated with Discord.**

</div>

---

## 🚀 About the Project

This project was born from the motivation to create a **limitless** and completely free "Watch Party" platform. By using Discord authentication, we combine the convenience of one of the most used tools by developers with a seamless entertainment experience.

The platform allows users to create rooms where video playback is **automatically synchronized** among all participants, ensuring everyone watches the same frame at the same time.

### Key Features

* **Discord Login:** Native integration for fast and secure authentication.
* **Real-Time Synchronization:** Play, Pause, and Seek synchronized for everyone in the room.
* **Integrated Chat:** Instant messaging within each room for real-time interaction.
* **Playlist Control:** Add YouTube videos in a simple and organized way.
